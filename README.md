# ATM Simulator - Python Project

This is a small Python project where I created an ATM system that works in the command line.  
The user needs to log in using a username and password, and after that they can do basic banking stuff like check balance, deposit, and withdraw money.

## üîê Login Details

- **Username:** admin  
- **Password:** 1234  

If the login is wrong, it won‚Äôt allow access.
